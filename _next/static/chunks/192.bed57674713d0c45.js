Each card represents an account you can use.","step2":"Click the \'Check Validity\' button for your desired account. This sends a request to our intelligent bot.","step3":"Our Telegram bot will instantly verify the account\'s status and send you the full details (including password and linked services) if it\'s active. This ensures you never get a bad account."},"safety_guide":{"title":"Safety & Best Practices","description":"To ensure a smooth and fair experience for everyone, following these community guidelines is mandatory. These rules exist to protect the longevity of the accounts and the community.","point1":"Never change the password. This is the most important rule. Changing the password locks everyone else out and will result in an immediate and permanent ban from our service.","point2":"Do not store any personal or sensitive information on these accounts. They are shared, so assume anything you add can be seen by others. Use them for their premium features only.","point3":"All accounts come with full Outlook inbox access. Feel free to use this to sign up for other services or for email verifications, but do not use it for personal correspondence."},"basics":{"title":"Usage Basics","questions":{"q1":{"q":"What is the purpose of this site?","a":"Outloox is an educational platform designed to provide transparent access to shared accounts for popular services. It allows users to explore premium features without needing a subscription. Our key differentiator is the instant verification system, which ensures the accounts you receive are active and working."},"q2":{"q":"How do I get the account password?","a":"The password, along with the email and other details, is delivered by our Telegram bot *after* you click the \'Check Validity\' button. This two-step process ensures that you only receive credentials for accounts that are confirmed to be working at that exact moment, saving you time and frustration."},"q3":{"q":"Is the service free?","a":"Yes, Outloox is completely free to use. There are no subscriptions or hidden costs. We maintain the service for educational and community purposes. To ensure fair access for everyone, we may implement daily usage limits."},"q4":{"q":"Can I use the bot directly in Telegram?","a":"Yes, you can! The bot is available 24/7 for quick checks. If you have an email and password you want to verify, you can send it directly to the bot in an `email:password` format. However, for browsing new accounts and getting the best experience, we always recommend starting on the web dashboard."}}},"verification_process":{"title":"Verification Process","questions":{"q1":{"q":"What does the \'Check Validity\' button do?","a":"When you click this button, it initiates a real-time verification process. Our bot attempts to log into the service using the account credentials. If successful, it gathers details like the account holder\'s name, country of origin, and linked services (e.g., Netflix). It\'s intelligent enough to distinguish between different failure types, such as a wrong password, a locked account, or a network error, and will inform you of the specific issue."},"q2":{"q":"Are the accounts I receive secure?","a":"\'Security\' here means the platform itself is secure, not the individual accounts. We provide transparent access, verify credentials to ensure they work, and manage the accounts. It is your responsibility to follow the community rules: do not change passwords and do not store sensitive personal data. Think of them as library books—available for everyone to use, but not for personal keeping."}}},"troubleshooting":{"title":"Troubleshooting","questions":{"q1":{"q":"What should I do if an account doesn\'t work?","a":"First, use the \'Check Validity\' button to get the very latest credentials from the bot, as the information on the website might not have updated yet. The most common reason for an account failing is that the password was recently updated by our admins."},"q2":{"q":"The bot said an account was \'no longer valid\'. What does that mean?","a":"This means that our instant verification check failed. The account was likely working before, but is now inaccessible. Common reasons include: the password was changed by an admin, the account was locked by the service provider, or it was removed from our system. This is the verification system working as intended—it prevented you from receiving a non-working account. Simply move on and try another one from the dashboard."},"q3":{"q":"The website is not loading or is empty. What\'s wrong?","a":"If the dashboard shows \'No accounts found,\' this is often normal as our account list is updated constantly. Check back soon for new additions. If the entire site won\'t load, try these steps: 1) Refresh the page. 2) Clear your browser cache. 3) Check your internet connection. If the problem persists, please use the Contact page to let us know."}}}},"footer":{"rights_reserved":"All rights reserved."}}')}}]);
