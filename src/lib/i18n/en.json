        "q2": {
          "q": "The bot said an account was 'no longer valid'. What does that mean?",
          "a": "This means that at the moment of your request, the account was no longer accessible (e.g., password was changed or it was locked). This is the benefit of the instant-check systemâ€”it prevents you from getting bad credentials. Simply try a different account."
