- Primary color: Purple (#A076F3) to capture the liquid glass aesthetic while feeling modern.
- Background color: Very light purple (#F1E9FF) to keep the page bright but consistent.
- Accent color: Light blue (#7493FF) to ensure an eye-catching contrast, while keeping the scheme cool and unified.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body, prioritizing readability.
- Ensure the layout is well-organized and responsive, adapting to different screen sizes, with an emphasis on clarity and ease of use.
- Incorporate relevant icons to enhance visual communication (e.g., icons for account details, validation status, language selection, etc.)
- Use subtle, fluid animations for interactions like expanding account containers or button clicks to enhance user engagement.
